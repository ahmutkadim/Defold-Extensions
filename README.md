# Defold-Extensions
This repo is for bringing all Defold extensions I recognize together.

# Usage
I am only using this repo for storing extensions as releases. It will not contain any source code.

#Purpose
Defold is a very limited piece of software. It requires extensions to be remotely useful. Yet I have decided to store ones that are useful in a single place so that I know they exist.
